Hi! My name is Tanishqa and welcome to my GitHub! It's a bit dry right now, though... But don't worry! It'll be bright and sunny soon! Currently, I'm working on a couple of projects! I'm building a smart mirror using a Raspberry PI and also working on a website to introduce myself! While you're here, though, you can look at my Woodland Project that I made in 3 days over the summer with a team! Thank you for visiting!
